You are given an array of positive numbers from which you must find the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.
Your function should be able to handle an undefined amount of arguments. 
For an empty argument list, the function should return 0.

Floating-point numbers are represented in computer hardware as base 2 (binary) fractions, 
since this is the case, we should check that the result is within 0.001 precision.
